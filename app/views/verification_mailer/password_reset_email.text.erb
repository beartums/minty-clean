<%= @user.username %>, here is your password reset code
===========================================================
 
A password reset request for your usename has been initiated. 
If you didn't ask for your password to be reset, then no further
action is needed.  Without this code (which has been sent exclusively
to this email address) your account is still secure.

Your username is: <%= @user.username %>
Your password reset code is: <%= @code %>
 
To set your new password and login to the site, copy this link to your address bar: 
<%= url_for(
      only_path: false, 
      controller: "api/v1/auth", 
      action: "reset_password", 
      username: @user.username, 
      code: @code
    )
%>
