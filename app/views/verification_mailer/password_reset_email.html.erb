    <h1><%= @user.username %>, here is your password reset code</h1>
    <p>
      A password reset request for your usename has been initiated. If you didn't ask for your password to be reset, then no further
      action is needed.  Without this code (which has been sent exclusively to this email address) your account is still secure.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Your username is: <%= @user.username %>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your password reset code is: <%= @code %>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you did request a reset, you can follow the link below: 
    </p>
    <p>
      <%= link_to(
        'Click here to go to Minty and create a new password',
        url_for(only_path: false, controller: "api/v1/auth", 
                action: "reset_password", 
                username: @user.username, code: @code)
